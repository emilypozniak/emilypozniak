Hi! My name is Emily Pozniak, and I am a student at the College of William and Mary. 
I am graduating in 2022 and looking for Data Analyst jobs!
In my Portfolio Project Repository, you can find projects I have done to showcase my skills.
I am interested in learning more about data analysis in Python, SQL, R, and data visualization in Tableau. 
You can contact me at ecpozniak@email.wm.edu! :)
