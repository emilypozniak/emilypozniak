Hi! My name is Emily Pozniak, and I am a student at the College of William and Mary graduating in 2022.
In my Portfolio Project Repository, you can find projects I have done to showcase my skills.
I am interested in learning more about data analysis in Python, SQL, and R.  
You can contact me at ecpozniak@email.wm.edu :)
